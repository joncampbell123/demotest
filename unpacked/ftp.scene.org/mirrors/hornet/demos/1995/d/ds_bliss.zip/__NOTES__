Notes:
- Demo runs A:\GO.EXE, which doesn't exist, but is brought into existence through hooking INT 13h to make a virtual floppy disk image in memory appear on drive A, MS-DOS is then expected to call INT 13h to see the floppy disk and access the files presented in it which of course includes GO.EXE.
Real hardware:
- 1997 Toshiba laptop: Demo starts fine.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo detects GUS IRQ/DMA just as badly as it does in DOSBox-X (IRQ 2/DMA0???). GUS support does not support IRQ > 7 (unfortunately my setup puts the GUS on IRQ 11). Demo runs otherwise. Not compatible with PAS.
