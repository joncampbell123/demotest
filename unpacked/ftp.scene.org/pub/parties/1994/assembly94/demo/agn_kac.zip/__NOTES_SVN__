Notes:
- Exits to DOS, leaves keyboard unresponsive. However real hardware testing shows the same, so it is a bug in the demo that is being emulated correctly.
Real hardware test results:
- TOSHIBA LAPTOP 1997 Yamaha OPL3-SAx: Left keyboard unresponsive, plus odd glitch artifacts in Sound Blaster (Pro?) output
