Notes:
- Gravis Ultrasound support will always complain about insufficient memory, no matter what. Will mark PASS if this occurs on REAL HARDWARE.
- Sound Blaster 16 support plays audio at the wrong sample rate because it sends the 16-bit sample rate in the wrong byte order.
! PLEASE TEST ON REAL HARDWARE
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, Sound Blaster Pro: Apparently 622KB conventional and 32MB extended is "not enough memory to load sound module"
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: GUS support claims not enough memory. PAS support complains not enough memory. Picky picky...
