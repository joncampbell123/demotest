Why the demo failed the test:
- Pauses at startup, does not continue until you hit a key. Then it complains about failure to detect refresh rate. Then runs normally. Does not have this problem with DOSBox SVN.
- Demo stops on last screen "BLOCC" and does not continue until you hit ESC to exit.
! TEST ON REAL HARDWARE !
