Why the demo failed the test:
- The text mode copperbars at the start of the demo do not appear. DOSBox SVN only emulates per-scanline rendering if machine=vgaonly.
- SIGMA65K.EXE uses 640x480 16-bit color does not display properly because the code uses wildly out of range window numbers when switching banks.
