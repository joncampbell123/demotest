Why the demo failed the test:
- Fails to load music, loop spins endlessly in memory. Hacky code fails to load music anyway
NOTES:
- Demo uses Big Real Mode (32-bit B bit on code segment in real mode)
- Failure to load music and data is caused by mismanagement of file handle. It stores it away and then fails to retrieve it properly when reading, so nothing reads.
- Relies on loading an alternate IDTR table in real mode to effectively intercept all interrupts without touching the real mode interrupt vector table.
