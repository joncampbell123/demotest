# ^ Demo has broken SVGA code that is hardcoded for bank switching with Window B.
#   This is needed to prevent all the graphics from getting bunched up in the first 64KB.
vesa bank switching window range check=false
# ^ Demo requires calls to set window number 0xFFFF to succeed or else end credits will
#   misrender sometimes. For this to work, window number range checking must be disabled.
#   Clearly this demo was written against a VESA BIOS that lacked window number and
#   range checking code.

# ^ Demo requires fast video memory for end credits. Evidently the code relies on time yet
#   pixel by pixel overdraw. If it cannot keep up, artifacts appear on screen.
