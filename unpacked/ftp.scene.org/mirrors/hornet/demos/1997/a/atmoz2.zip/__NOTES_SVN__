NOTES:
- The menu is correctly showing what keys to press for each sound card, including the Gravis Ultrasound option which can only be selected by holding ALT and typing 0145 (Ã¦).
Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo seems glitchy and broken, eventually music slows down, 3D animation slows down, and then gets stuck. How the hell did this win 9th place in a compo?
