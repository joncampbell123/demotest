Why the demo failed the test:
- Sound Blaster 16 support does not work. Will mark PASS if the problem exists on real hardware. Appears to play and cycle DMA correctly, just no sound. CHECK ON REAL HARDWARE.
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, Sound Blaster Pro: Sound Blaster playback doesn't work (looping garbage) unless you run with LOADFIX, just as in DOSBox-X.
