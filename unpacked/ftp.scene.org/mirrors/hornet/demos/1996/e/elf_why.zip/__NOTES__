Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo has visual glitches and errors if you select Sound Blaster output. No such errors with GUS. PLEASE CHECK AGAINST REAL HARDWARE.
- The ANSI portion appeared to have vertical alignment issues. PLEASE CHECK AGAINST REAL HARDWARE.
- "ANSI.SYS not found" later on in the demo?
Notes:
- This demo runs entirely in real mode and uses EMM386.EXE to access memory beyond 640k. It may be using a real mode tracker that also uses expanded memory if Sound Blaster is involved.

PLEASE TEST ON REAL HARDWARE
