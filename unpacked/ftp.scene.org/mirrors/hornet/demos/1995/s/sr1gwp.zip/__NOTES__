Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo loops endlessly at part 2 (the 3D flying text). According to real hardware, the demo skips a whole part, goes straight to flying text. In fact the sequence in DOSBox-X is completely different from real hardware!
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: Runs fine with Sound Blaster. Demo got stuck endlessly repeating the closing credits.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: 486SX/33MHz "This CPU is too late!!! (0110)"
TODO:
- Please re-test this demo on more hardware
