Why the demo failed the test:
- Uses protected mode. "Mapped vectors" eventually causes a divide by zero fault which is very poorly handled by the code.
Real hardware test:
- Toshiba Laptop, 1997, Pentium, MS-DOS 6.22: Crashed to DOS with an exception immediately
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Runs normally, does not crash (Something to do with 486SX/33MHz?). No sound. Exits to DOS normally.
