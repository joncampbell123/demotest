NOTES:
- Demo uses banked VESA BIOS 640x480 256-color mode, then uses segment limits and GP faults to emulate a linear framebuffer. The demo cannot draw on screen correctly without GP faults.
- The demo seems to rely on a 64KB bank switching window at A0000h where the next 64KB is at B0000h (undocumented behavior). Without that, the demo can end up incompletely drawing some things.
