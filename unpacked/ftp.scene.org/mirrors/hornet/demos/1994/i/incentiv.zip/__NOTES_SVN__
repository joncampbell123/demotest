Notes:
- GUS playback routine has the common bug that causes random I/O ports to be accessed during the demo. A patch is applied to the EXE to fix this.
- The demo installs a keyboard ISR, but the ISR gets corrupted at some point, and the demo does not restore the original ISR on exit. A TSR is run to fix this.
