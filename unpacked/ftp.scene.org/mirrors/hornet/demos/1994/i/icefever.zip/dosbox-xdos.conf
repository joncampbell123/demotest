# ^ This hack is needed so the music sounds better.
#   The demo appears to program 14 channels during GUS reset, then after reset change to
#   16 channels (while playing music as if 14 which is why the music sounds wrong).
#   I'm still not sure if the music with this hack is a correct rendition but it sounds
#   better than without.
