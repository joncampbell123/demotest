Why the demo failed the test:
- Last demo part shows nothing on the screen. Debugging functions show that the palette is completely black and it tried to open an endpart.pal.
- When credits finish, screen remains blank, but you are at the DOS prompt.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba laptop 1997: Crashed, hung
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo runs normally, then crashes/hangs (with audible beeps from the 486SX unit).
