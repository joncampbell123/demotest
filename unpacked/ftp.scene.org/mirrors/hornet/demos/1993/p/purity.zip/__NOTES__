Notes:
- Demo palette handling seems to require Paradise/Western digital VGA DAC behavior, or else VGA palette is all wrong.
TODO:
- Run the demo on various SVGA chipsets to see where it works and where it fails. Perhaps the DOSBox-X implemented behavior for machine=svga_paradise is more common than thought.
