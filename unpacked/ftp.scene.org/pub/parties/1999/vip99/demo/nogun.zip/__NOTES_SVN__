Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo runs, displays "guns" and rotating object, then crashes.
- One likely reason the demo crashes is that it cannot load some of
  it's files. Some files in the DATA directory do not fit into the
  8.3 filename limit, suggesting that this DOS demo is intended
  to run in a DOS box under Windows 95/98 since there does exist an
  API to access "Long Filenames" from DOS within Windows 95/98.
  Getting this demo to run may require implementation of Long
  Filenames.
