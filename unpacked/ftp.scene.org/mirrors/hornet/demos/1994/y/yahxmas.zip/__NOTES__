NOTES:
- Demo was written for Creative SB2/SBPro hardware where DSP command 0x41 happens to be an alias of 0x40 (set time constant). It does NOT support SB16 cards.
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997 (Sound Blaster Pro compatible): Audio does not play (as if unable to process IRQ). Possibly same issues.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Sound Blaster Pro setting doesn't work (well, it is a Pro Audio Spectrum). 486SX/33MHz
