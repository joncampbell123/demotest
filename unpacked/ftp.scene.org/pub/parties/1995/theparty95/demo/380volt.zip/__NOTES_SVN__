Why the demo failed the test:
- If cycle count is above about 17000, then when beginning the looping animation, GUS music stops, and the demo never proceeds past the animation. The demo seems to require file I/O delay between changing video modes and starting the animation, or else it misses a vital cue.
- Title screen glitches during unpack (SVN does not implement CTTY command, used by the demo to run PKUNZIP with STDOUT redirected to NUL)
