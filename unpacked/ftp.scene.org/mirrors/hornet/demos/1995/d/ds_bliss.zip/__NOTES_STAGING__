Why the demo failed the test:
- Executes A:\GO.EXE which doesn't exist. SVN does not support directing FAT filesystem I/O through INT 13h which would make this work.
Real hardware:
- 1997 Toshiba laptop: Demo starts fine.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo detects GUS IRQ/DMA just as badly as it does in DOSBox-X (IRQ 2/DMA0???). GUS support does not support IRQ > 7 (unfortunately my setup puts the GUS on IRQ 11). Demo runs otherwise. Not compatible with PAS.
