Description
HOW2CHAT is a program which pretends to "chat" with your callers, 
originally written in MBASIC for CP/M to fool the folks calling my 
single-line BBS into thinking someone else was actually online and 
chatting with them. These have been rewritten, using the DOORSORC 
libraries, to work under a single node of PCBoard 14.x (but it has only 
been tested on 14.5). Version 2.0 features a separate data file which 
lets you edit the keywords and responses, and entries in the config file 
will let you choose the name of the computer chatter, and the name of 
the file to which the chat sessions are logged.Also in this version is a 
sophisticated mistake generator and keyboard delay table which is almost 
impossible to tell from a real person typng...ooops, typing.

The Anatomically Correct BBS	Second Line= Your BBS name
Howeird				Third Line= Who we are chatting with
!				Fourth Line= Sysop's name
c:\cheri\cheri.dat              Fifth line = path & name of data file
c:\bbs\chat.log			6th line = name of log file

Modify the CHERI and HOWEIRD files for your BBS

CHERI:
Echo Off
CD\PCB\DOORS\CHERI20
How2chat cheri.cfg
cd\pcb
board

HOWEIRD:
Echo Off

The programs monitor the comm port for you, no need for Watchdog 
programs.

BRUN45.EXE is required to be in your LIB directory (use the DOS command 
SET LIB= path) or in the same directory as the xxxChat.EXE files if you 
are running HOWCHAT.EXE.

Growing Your Own Chat:

The DAT files are set up this way:

"KEYWORD","#"
"Response"
"Response" 
"Response"
"KEYWORD","#"
"Response"
etc.

The KEYWORD is the word in the sentence typed in by the caller which you want 
the computer to respond to. The "#" is an integer between 1 and 10, which 
tells how many responses there are for that keyword. The following lines 
are for the responses for that keyword.

CheriChat 2.0 requires exactly 40 keywords. Each keyword can have 
between 1 and 10 responses. Keywords must be in UPPER CASE.

If you use the wrong number of keywords or responses, the program will burp.
Loudly.

Following the last response, the DAT file expects 25 opening lines. The 
program automatically sticks the caller's name at the end of each opening 
line. Each time the program is run, it picks an opening line at random.

If you want to change the source code and recompile, you will need 
DOORSORC 3.2 libraries and Microsoft QBasic 4.5. DS32.ZIP is available 
on many PCBoard BBSs, QBasic 4.5 can be bought wherever DOS software is 
sold.

If you make major improvements to the program or DAT files, please send 
a courtesy copy to Howeird.
