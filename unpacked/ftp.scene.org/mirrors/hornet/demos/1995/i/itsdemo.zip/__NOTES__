Why the demo failed the test:
- Crashes on startup. Runs in a 16-bit DOS extender. Uses VESA BIOS extensions to set up 640x480x256 color mode. Crashes after modeset.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Program requires a mouse
NOTES:
- Attempts to run the demo with EMM386.EXE emulation enabled (vm86 mode) triggered a different error message about lack of Virtual DMA support
