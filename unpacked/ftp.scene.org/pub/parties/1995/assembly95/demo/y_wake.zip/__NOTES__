Why the demo failed the test:
- Sound Blaster support crashes and resets the emulator
- Demo pauses midway through because it tries to read a byte from STDERR (INT AH=3Fh BX(file handle)=2). Pressing a key will continue the demo, but that is a bug. TODO: What does MS-DOS do if you try to read from a CON handle opened as STDERR?
