Notes:
- Sound Blaster Pro support will hang, playing garbage data, if the demo also detected a Gravis Ultrasound,
  however at least it will also default to the Gravis Ultrasound if you hit enter.
- Sound Blaster Pro support starts with a 1-byte DMA buffer, which falsely triggers DOSBox-X's goldplay mode,
  and let that play until the demo is ready to run, but the demo will change the DMA base count to the final
  length later when running.
- If you select "Sound Blaster 16" you must specify the 16-bit DMA channel (usually 5)
  or the demo will not play any music.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba 1997 Pentium with SBPro compatible OPL3-SAx: Sound Blaster Pro support works perfectly fine, does not hang as described above. However the 3D maze runs too fast, and exhibits Mode X tearlines.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: GUS support works fine. SBPro selection detected the PAS and refused, properly.
