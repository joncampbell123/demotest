Why the demo failed the test:
- Unable to run the demo. Executes A:\GO.EXE, which doesn't actually exist, but the demo depends on MS-DOS calling an INT 13h hook to intercept floppy access and fake a floppy disk with that file to make it run.
Real hardware:
- 1997 Toshiba laptop: Demo starts fine.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo detects GUS IRQ/DMA just as badly as it does in DOSBox-X (IRQ 2/DMA0???). GUS support does not support IRQ > 7 (unfortunately my setup puts the GUS on IRQ 11). Demo runs otherwise. Not compatible with PAS.
