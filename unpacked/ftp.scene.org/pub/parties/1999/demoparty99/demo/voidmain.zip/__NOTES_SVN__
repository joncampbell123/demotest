NOTES:
- This demo has code to ensure the CPU has MMX extensions, however the test is flawed in that it does a (EDX & mask) != 0 test, the mask of which includes many unrelated features like whether CMPXCHG8B is present and whether a reserved bit is set, whether ACPI MSRs are present, but it does at least cover the MMX bit too. This demo DOES correctly detect that DOSBox SVN does not support MMX instructions.
- This demo will crash when run in any MS-DOS environment after displaying "When you wish upon a star". Sadly, this crash is accurate to how it runs on real hardware. Despite the NFO file, this demo will only correctly run in a DOS "box" under Windows 95/98 and it was clearly not tested in pure DOS mode. The demo at some point corrupts lower conventional memory below 64KB which causes a crash at the next INT 21h call.
- This demo was extensively covered in the DOSBox-X issue tracker: https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues/3102
