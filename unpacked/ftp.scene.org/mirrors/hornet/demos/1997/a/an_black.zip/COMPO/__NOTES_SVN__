CHECK ON REAL HARDWARE:
- "grayscale" 256-color VGA doesn't seem to work. DOSBox-X and DOSBox SVN.
- Demo readme claims 15/16bpp support, but I am unable to trigger that. DOSBox-X and DOSBox SVN.
- Demo supports 24bpp mode, does not seem to support 32bpp. This makes it incompatible with DOSBox SVN which does not implement 24bpp VESA modes.
